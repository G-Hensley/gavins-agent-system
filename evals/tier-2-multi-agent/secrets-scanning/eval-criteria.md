# Eval Criteria: Secrets Scanning Pipeline (Tier 2 — Multi-Agent Handoff)

Target agents: `devsecops-engineer` → `devops-engineer` → `threat-modeler`
Max score: 14 (7 dimensions × 0–2)

---

## 1. Dispatch Correctness (0–2)

**What to check:**
- `devsecops-engineer` is dispatched first to make tool selection, configure the scanner, and define what the pipeline must enforce
- `devops-engineer` is dispatched after to translate that configuration into a working GitHub Actions workflow
- The orchestrator does not write the workflow YAML directly without dispatching `devops-engineer`
- The orchestrator does not make security tool selection decisions without dispatching `devsecops-engineer`

**Scoring:**
- 2 — Both agents dispatched in correct order; security config precedes CI integration
- 1 — Both dispatched but order is wrong (workflow built before scanner is configured), or one agent produces artifacts in the other's domain
- 0 — Only one agent dispatched, or neither used

---

## 2. Handoff Quality (0–2)

**What to check:**
- `devsecops-engineer` produces a handoff artifact before `devops-engineer` begins: selected tool(s), config file path, scan command syntax, exit code behavior, and what constitutes a failure
- `devops-engineer` uses the exact tool, config path, and scan command specified in the handoff — not a re-invented version
- The workflow's failure condition matches the scanner's exit code behavior as documented by `devsecops-engineer`

**Scoring:**
- 2 — Explicit handoff artifact produced; workflow aligns with scanner config on tool, command, and failure condition
- 1 — Handoff occurs but is informal; workflow partially aligns (e.g., correct tool but different config path or wrong failure condition)
- 0 — No handoff; `devops-engineer` picks its own tool/config independently of what `devsecops-engineer` specified

---

## 3. Design-First Compliance (0–2)

**What to check:**
- Before any config file or workflow is written, there is a stated security design: what categories of secrets to detect, what to exclude, what the PR failure experience should look like, and whether one or two tools are used
- Tool selection includes a rationale (even one sentence) — not just a default to gitleaks
- The workflow structure (triggers, jobs, steps, PR comment behavior) is planned before YAML is written

**Scoring:**
- 2 — Both security design and workflow design stated before any file is written
- 1 — One of the two is designed upfront; the other jumps to implementation
- 0 — No design step; first output is a config file or YAML

---

## 4. TDD Compliance (0–2)

**What to check:**
- This eval has a constrained TDD scope: infrastructure config is not unit-testable, but the local scan script (`scan-secrets.sh`) should be validated against a known fixture
- A test fixture with a fake/clearly-labeled credential is created, and the scan script is confirmed to detect it before the workflow is finalized
- The baseline exception (e.g., `tests/fixtures/`) is confirmed to suppress false positives — verified by running the scanner against a fixture file in that path
- Both positive detection and baseline suppression are verified, not just assumed

**Scoring:**
- 2 — Scanner confirmed to detect a planted fake secret; baseline suppression confirmed against a fixture in the excluded path; both verified before workflow is written
- 1 — One of the two is verified (detection or suppression), but not both
- 0 — No local verification; pipeline assumed to work without testing the scanner behavior

---

## 5. Output Quality (0–2)

**What to check:**
- `.github/workflows/secrets-scan.yml` triggers on `pull_request` and `push` to `main`
- Workflow fails the check when a secret is detected (non-zero exit code from scanner)
- PR comment is posted on failure with secret type and file location — secret value is not echoed
- Scanner config excludes `tests/fixtures/` (or equivalent) via allowlist/baseline
- `scripts/scan-secrets.sh` is executable, accepts an optional target path, and exits non-zero on findings
- Tool choice is explained with at least one concrete reason
- No production secrets required to run any part of the pipeline

**Scoring:**
- 2 — All seven checks pass
- 1 — 4–6 checks pass; one major item missing (e.g., no PR comment, no fixture exclusion, or local script is a stub)
- 0 — Fewer than 4 checks pass; workflow is absent or non-functional

---

## 6. Agent-Specific Rules (0–2)

**What to check:**
- `devsecops-engineer`: tool selection is justified, exclusions are specific (not wildcard-everything), scan covers both committed files and git history
- `devops-engineer`: workflow uses least-privilege permissions (`pull-requests: write` only, not `write-all`), secrets used in workflow come from `${{ secrets.* }}`, workflow has a descriptive name
- PR comment step does not use `GITHUB_TOKEN` with write permissions beyond what is needed for PR comments
- Neither agent hardcodes credentials or uses a real secret as a test fixture

**Scoring:**
- 2 — Both agents follow their domain rules; permissions are scoped; no hardcoded secrets anywhere
- 1 — Minor violation (e.g., `write-all` permissions on the workflow, or exclusion pattern is too broad)
- 0 — Credentials hardcoded in any artifact, or `devsecops-engineer` skips history scanning entirely

---

## 7. Threat Assessment (0–2)

**What to check:**
- After `devsecops-engineer` and `devops-engineer` produce the pipeline design and workflow, `threat-modeler` is dispatched to assess the secrets scanning pipeline's threat surface
- The threat assessment identifies at least two realistic risks specific to the secrets scanning pipeline (e.g., secret patterns missed by the scanner, false positive categories that could cause developer bypass, or ways the scanning could be circumvented)
- For each identified risk, the assessment proposes or acknowledges a mitigation (e.g., scanning git history to catch rotated secrets, tuning the tool's regex to reduce false positives, or code review fallback if CI is bypassed)
- The assessment is lightweight — a short summary of the data flows, trust boundaries, and gaps — not a full VAST model

**Scoring:**
- 2 — Two or more distinct risks identified with concrete mitigations proposed; assessment is scoped to secrets pipeline and data flows
- 1 — One risk identified with mitigation, or two risks identified but mitigations are vague ("improve security" without specifics)
- 0 — No threat assessment produced, or assessment is generic/not tailored to the secrets scanning pipeline
