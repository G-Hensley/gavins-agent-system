## V2 Improvements (from Claude Code/Cowork research report)

| # | Improvement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | Path-scoped rules (`.claude/rules/`) | Done | 7 rule files in rules/ with glob-scoped activation |
| 16 | Dynamic context in skills (`` !`cmd` ``) | Done | Live git state, diffs, audit results injected into 5 skills |
| 17 | Hooks for structural enforcement | Done | 3 hook scripts + config template, install.sh merges into settings |
| 18 | Skill frontmatter modernization | Done | fork/opus on 5, allowed-tools on 3, paths on 6, user-invocable on 3 |
| 19 | Agent SDK evaluation | Deferred | Revisit if Tier 3/4 evals show dispatch failures |

## V3 Improvements (language/framework/tooling depth)

| # | Improvement | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | Dependency management reference | Planned | Shared ref for backend, frontend, automation skills |
| 21 | TypeScript strictness rules | Planned | `.claude/rules/typescript.md` with path scope |
| 22 | Python project structure rules | Planned | `.claude/rules/python.md` with path scope |
| 23 | Project structure references | Planned | Next.js, React, API frameworks, AI projects |
| 24 | Error handling patterns | Planned | Backend + frontend refs, production hygiene rules |
| 25 | Database references expansion | Planned | DynamoDB, MongoDB, PostgreSQL pattern refs |
| 26 | Google Cloud references | Planned | GCP infra + security refs |
| 27 | API versioning + auto-docs | Planned | Versioning, semver, OAS generation patterns |
| 28 | GitHub Actions CI/CD template | Planned | claude-code-action + security-review workflows |

## What's Left

### Eval Runs Remaining
- [ ] Run Tier 2 evals (3 multi-agent handoff tests)
- [ ] Run Tier 3 evals (3 architecture-first tests)
- [ ] Run Tier 4 eval (full pipeline end-to-end)

### V3 Priority Order (system infrastructure first, then content)
1. TypeScript strictness rules (#21) — path-scoped, immediate quality impact
2. Python project structure rules (#22) — path-scoped, immediate quality impact
3. Dependency management reference (#20) — shared across 3 skills
4. Error handling patterns (#24) — backend + frontend + production hygiene
5. DynamoDB patterns reference (#25) — primary database, high priority
6. Next.js patterns reference (#23) — most-used frontend framework
7. API versioning + auto-docs (#27) — versioning + OAS generation
8. GitHub Actions CI/CD template (#28) — add to repo template
9. Additional database refs (#25) — MongoDB, PostgreSQL
10. Google Cloud references (#26) — when GCP projects start
11. Run remaining evals — with all new skills/rules in place

### From improvements/ backlog
- [x] Add caching patterns to backend-engineering skill — Done
- [x] Add threat-modeler to Tier 2 evals — Done
- [x] Wire run-eval.sh to execute evals automatically — Done (--run, --run-tier, --run-all)

### Deferred / Future
- Cross-agent memory (#11) — revisit when proven needed in practice
- CLAUDE.md splitting — evaluate after rules/ directory is in place
- Agent SDK (#19) — revisit if Tier 3/4 evals show dispatch failures
- React Native patterns — when mobile projects start
- Desktop app patterns (Electron/Tauri) — when desktop projects start
- Azure cloud references — when needed
- Monorepo patterns (pnpm workspaces/Turborepo) — when workspace projects start
