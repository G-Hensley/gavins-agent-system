## What's Left

### Eval Runs
- [x] Run Tier 2 evals — 3/3 passed
- [x] Run Tier 3 evals — 3/3 passed
- [x] Run Tier 4 eval — PASSED (full pipeline, 104 tests, 22 threats, 10 review findings)

### V3 Priority Order (system infrastructure first, then content)
1. TypeScript strictness rules (#21) — path-scoped, immediate quality impact
2. Python project structure rules (#22) — path-scoped, immediate quality impact
3. Dependency management reference (#20) — shared across 3 skills
4. Error handling patterns (#24) — backend + frontend + production hygiene
5. DynamoDB patterns reference (#25) — primary database, high priority
6. Next.js patterns reference (#23) — most-used frontend framework
7. API versioning + auto-docs (#27) — versioning + OAS generation
8. GitHub Actions CI/CD template (#28) — add to repo template
9. Additional database refs (#25) — MongoDB, PostgreSQL
10. Google Cloud references (#26) — when GCP projects start
11. Run remaining evals — with all new skills/rules in place

### From improvements/ backlog
- [x] Add caching patterns to backend-engineering skill — Done
- [x] Add threat-modeler to Tier 2 evals — Done
- [x] Wire run-eval.sh to execute evals automatically — Done (--run, --run-tier, --run-all)

### Deferred / Future
- Cross-agent memory (#11) — revisit when proven needed in practice
- CLAUDE.md splitting — evaluate after rules/ directory is in place
- Agent SDK (#19) — revisit if Tier 3/4 evals show dispatch failures
- React Native patterns — when mobile projects start
- Desktop app patterns (Electron/Tauri) — when desktop projects start
- Azure cloud references — when needed
- Monorepo patterns (pnpm workspaces/Turborepo) — when workspace projects start
